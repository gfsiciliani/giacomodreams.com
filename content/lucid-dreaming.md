lucid dreaming book
dada and surrealism
turning point in harnessing the power of my dreams
I do not share my dreams, but rather they share with me, and I am a conduit of expressing something of them. I will never share the content of my dreams here, but instead my communications of my interpretations of the truths discovered in dreaming.
